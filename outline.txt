1. Brief intro
    * highlight origins
    * scope of survey
2. Definition 
    * formal definition + figure illustrating the breg div as the
    difference between a function and its first-order approximation
    * conjugate function and properties useful for breg divs
3. Origins
    * origin in convex optimization (maybe skip on 1st iteration)
    * connection to exponential families
    * csiszar's axiomatic work
    * information geometric stuff
4. Geometry
    * pythagorean thm
    * technical results: centroidal property (though we might cover
    this above), composability, difference of two divergences as an
    affine set.
    * connection to k-means
    * projection onto a bregman ball; dually-linear stuff.
    * voronoi/delaunay, etc.
