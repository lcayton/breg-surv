1. Brief intro
2. Definition & Motivation
    * formal definition + figure illustrating the breg div as the
    difference between a function and its first-order approximation
    * generalization of l_2 + KL divergence; connection to k-means
    * origin in convex optimization
    * csiszar's axiomatic work
    * information geometric stuff
    * connection to exponential families
3. Geometry
    * pythagorean thm
    * conjugacy, fenchel-young
    * technical results: centroidal property (though we might cover
    this above), composability, difference of two divergences as an
    affine set.
    * projection onto a bregman ball; dually-linear stuff.
    * voronoi/delaunay, etc.
